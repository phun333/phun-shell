# Phun Shell

This is a basic shell implementation written in Java.  
I started this project to improve my Java skills by building a custom shell from scratch.

I'm also using test cases and challenges from [CodeCrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) as a reference to guide the development and verify the behavior of the shell.

## 🔧 Features

- `exit 0` to exit the shell
- `echo` command support
- `type` command to check if a command is a shell builtin or an external executable
- Executes external system commands using `ProcessBuilder`

## 📦 How to Run

Make sure you have Java installed. Then compile and run the project:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Main.java` — Core shell logic: input reading, command parsing, execution
